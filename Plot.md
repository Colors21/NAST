Plot: 

Text shows up on the screen stating various settings, the User doesn't know what each setting does. 

  "SPEAKER: OFF"

  "INCINERATE: OFF"

  "RELEASE: OFF"

The User will be given an option to turn one of these settings on. 

  "SPEAKER" Will idealy turn on the speaker, creating a large buzzing sound to indicate the speaker is on. The Character asks, "Who is      that"
  
  "INCINIRATE" Will turn make a loud noise, vaguely familiar to that of old gears. The user automatically hears a voice screaming, asking   whats going on, he states he doesn't want to die. The User is given the option to turn it off twice, if the machine doesn't stop then    it will automatically get stuck. Thus triggering the speaker, and the character asks "Who's there" faint anger is shown in his tone of   voice.
  
  "RELEASE" Will again trigger a loud sound, familiar to that of gears. It automatically gets stuck. The speaker turns on and the          character states "Where am i?". Sounding optimistic.
